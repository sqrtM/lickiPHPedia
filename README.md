# lickiPHPedia

homemade backend for [Lickipedia](https://github.com/sqrtM/lickipedia-ideo). just a basic cli.

I was originally using pocketbase for this, but I needed to learn PHP for work, so I figured I'd teach myself by going ahead and building a backend to one of my favorite projects. Not robust or interesting, but fun to work on nonetheless.

## TODO

### PHP
1. Ensure no SQL injections are possible.
2. Check empties with the empty() function.
3. Templating with Twig?
4. Better error handling
5. More OO.

### SQL
1. No *.
2. Tables for users, licks, and two others (?)
3. Better foreign key management.
