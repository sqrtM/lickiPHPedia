# lickiPHPedia

homemade backend for [Lickipedia](https://github.com/sqrtM/lickipedia-ideo).

I was originally using pocketbase for this, but I needed to learn PHP for work, so I figured I'd teach myself by going ahead and building a backend to one of my favorite projects. Not robust or interesting, but fun to work on nonetheless.
